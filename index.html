Years ago, I got so sick of not being able to answer the deep-dive technical questions, and I knew I had to do something different. I started taking detailed notes in every interview, writing down the questions they asked to which I didn't know the answers. More than once, I could tell that the person doing the interview stopped asking questions before they reached the end of their question list (because I was no longer able to answer them) so I asked him if he would be willing to provide me a complete list of all the questions he *would* ask if I was able to answer them all. He did so.

Then, I would go home and work my brains out trying to grasp the concepts they were asking about that I didn't know. In every case, I would email back the hiring manager (even days or weeks later) to say, "I have studied all the things you asked me about that I didn't know how to answer in our interview. Now, I would be able to answer them. If you ever have another position come open, I hope you will reconsider me."

One time, that actually paid off. And at that job, I learned a TON, and that's the job I credit for moving me from junior/mid-level to expert.

Hope this helps.`,

I worked with a .NET Developer that was a history high school teacher for 10 years prior - he was an amazing mentor and could really explain things well. I’ve also worked with a Software Developer who was a mechanic in a past life. His attention to detail and how a software system worked as a whole and what it would affect given changing different parts was really showing of him previously being a mechanic.

The whole process took me 6 months: from printing “Hello World” November 2018 to landing my first internship in May 2019, where I then transitioned to becoming a full time junior engineer.

Though I do admit that luck probably had plenty to do with where I am, I’m sure with perseverance you can definitely do it.

Also would like to note that on top of building things I kept my computer science fundamentals sharp by reading Data Structure and Algorithms textbooks and did tons of problems both from the book and on this website called Hackerrank, as I knew most interviews would have some problem-solving component.

A good way to minimize that is to build something specific. If it’s web development than try focusing on the header or the footer or something…. If it’s mobile try a small interaction.

If you start to feel like you suck and this isn’t for you, go play video games, watch a movie, get drunk (if you’re over 21), smoke some weed, and relax. You still will suck the next day but at least you will give your brain a rest from all of that over thinking like we all do everyday.

The only way to learn a programming language well, is by building applications.

It's practically a cliché at this point, I get it. But it holds true. If you can obtain a B.S. in Comp Sci, worst case scenario you'll start around 30/hr on the very bottom end of gig work. Even without the degree, if you can deliver, you'll get work (check out Udemy etc. - MIT has all of their online course content available fore free, and theirs is the gold standard CS program). The degree does make it easier. If you stay the course, after about five years of experience things will really start to open up financially. Most salaried positions at reputable companies require background checks. Over half of hourly IT contracts do not. Most companies don't even look at felonies after 7 years. So by the time you've truly developed your skills and established yourself, you can transition to a traditional salaried role. TBH, most middle men companies in the contracts don't verify anything. I don't abuse/leverage that, but if I had to, I probably would - at least to get the ball rolling.

I'm currently doing over 30k/month. On pace to do 380k in 2022, from home, software dev. My workweek is less than 40 hrs. I did a fifteen month prison sentence, released in late 2016, 11 felonies. I was living in a half way house until March 2017.

Now I've been at this for nearly fifteen years off and on, graduated in 2006. And I'm really good at what I do, definitely in the top tier in terms of talent. You may never hit this level financially. But not only is it possible, if you're under 30 and can keep your nose clean its probable. Salary packages and bonuses at major IT companies can go well beyond what I'm earning.

DO NOT let your criminal history limit your potential, don't let it be an excuse. I was in a half way house with nothing and no savings five years ago. In five more I'll be retired.

I am a front end developer and if you choose to go down the FE path here's what I suggest:

Get a good understanding of the command line and git workflow. You will need this no matter what tech stack you end up learning.

Learn vanilla Javascript and learn it well. Build a few small projects with html 5, css(sass), vanilla js. Get very proficient at all of these. Be able to speak about them intelligently.

Practice code wars katas. These will help your logic for your technical interview prep.

Once you've become quite comfortable with js learn React. It's amazing and there are a ton of jobs in it. Learn it in and out. Learn how to use it with Redux and Typescript. Learn hooks. Learn how to test it with Jest or Cypress. If you don't know what any of this means reference it later on. Build several functional projects in it with tests.

I would also suggest learning Angular, and next.js.

Your road to finding a full time junior dev position as someone completely self taught will be somewhat challenging but not impossible.

I'd suggest finding a good (emphasis on good) bootcamp if possible. The good ones offer a lot of benefit from network to having to build projects on a team to mock interviews. It'll just be a much faster path to a career. If not going through a front end curriculum online through udemy or code academy etc is a good idea.`,

There are, however, plenty of free courses online that cover all the bases, I’d suggest Mike Dane’s freecodecamp tutorials. Bear in mind once again that programming isn’t something you can take a 3-month certification course on at your local trade school and then hop right into a job. It requires hours and hours of personal time, a desire to grow and develop, and the ability to keep learning and solve problems when you’re stuck on something, be it hours, days, or weeks on end.

Comparing them with some of the less experienced people I've worked with, the main thing that jumps out is that they expend less effort on learning frameworks and technologies and more effort on understanding the problems they're trying to solve.

They have a decade or more experience solving similar problems and fixing errors and they learn from them and apply those lessons to new projects. This means they can preempt problems that other people haven't even considered.

I agree that tech is always changing and new frameworks are always emerging, but the fact that they're usually re-inventing the wheel is kind of beneficial in that we've seen it all before.

So yes, I think it's possible to become an expert, but being up to speed on the latest versions isn't necessary to become one.`,

               quote: `I'm a grizzled old veteran (well, kinda) in that I've been programming on and off for well over 30 years now. I am the co-founder/CTO of a successful software-based startup which was created from a side project of mine (we have an office, healthy investment, enough money in the bank to operate for a year without doing any actual business if we had to, customers and employees - we must be doing something right!)

Back in the 80s when I was learning to program, the IT world was a lot simpler. At University, most things were C, UNIX and data structure theory. This meant we could focus on those core things without the distractions of the 100+ programming languages that are floating around today (yeah, we had SML, Fortran, Modula II, Cobol and so Forth but we didn't pay a huge amount of attention for the most part to those tbh).

Here's my advice:

1) Don't stress it. After a year of learning to program I'd progressed to the point I was writing small programs in bad code. At the time I thought they were great.

2) Don't quit on it. Keep calm and carry on. Rome wasn't built in a day, and the more you realise (I'm British, we spell it that way!) you don't know, the better you'll get if you do keep going.

3) Take some time to study basic data structures (linked lists, double linked lists, arrays and binary trees being the main ones), I have a fondness for Finite State Machines as well, but I didn't discover how absolutely fantastic they were until much later. Do the basics, then you'll discover the rest as a natural consequence of your curiousity.

4) 99.9% of programmers regularly google (or otherwise look up) stuff. Don't worry about it. In the old days we looked it up in books. Google is quicker. You'll never stop reaching out for reference material in reality.

5) People online, especially these days, portray themselves as more confident than they really are. Everyone's an armchair expert with an opinion. Most of them haven't achieved a huge amount, but they like to talk about how things should be done. Don't compare yourself to others in this regard. Focus on you, what you're doing, and your reference material.

6) I would recommend you pick up a little bit of good old-fashioned C. You don't have to be an expert or learn it thoroughly, but it will teach you so much about how a computer works. C is basically pseudo-code for algorithms. It's not fashionable I know, but it'll stand you in good stead.

7) Continue with C++ once you've done a bit of C. C++ is very different in many ways, especially in syntax, (and of course the fact it has object-orientated stuff like classes) but the underlying concepts are not. Personally, I dislike it, but that's just me - I found my path and it was C. Yours may well be C++.

8) Create a hobby project to work on, that you like working on, and work on it. I wrote a command line shell back roundabout '88, which had support for variables, macros, my own implementations of the basic UNIX commands such as 'ls', 'cat', 'more' and simulations of pipes etc. I did it one step at a time and I loved it. It taught me so much. I even wrote my own little regex engine for it, supporting a subset of what we call regex today.

9) Read articles, even if you don't fully understand them, about concepts relevant to the language or projects you're working on.

Programming is 75% perseverance. You'll be ready for the other 25% when you realise that it automatically happened while you were persevering. I've written hundreds of thousands of lines of code, if not millions in my career (and for most of my career I wasn't a developer but a field engineer), in a number of languages, and the majority of that was figuring out how to do something, trying stuff out and experimenting, debugging etc. I ended up back where I started, writing C, only a hell of a lot better at it (and now providing jobs for a few others as a side effect).

Believe in yourself. If you want to do it, you can do it. The only variables in that equation are time and commitment.

At some point pick a language you like - it could be Rust, it could be C++, it could be Swift or something we haven't heard of yet, but there's no hurry. When you've done that, focus on it.

I've seen so many hot trends come and go that I don't really notice a lot of them any more. I steer well clear of anything that's in a constant state of churn, or has massive framework-based environments (web development in general springs to mind). EDIT: I should add that I have nothing against web development at all, it's just not my thing. I'm glad there are lots of people who can do great things with it (our company depends on it for the GUI and API components, for example), and ultimately their work is likely to improve the situation in the long run.

I could start to ramble at this point, but I think I conveyed my key point, which is focus + time = results. Oh, and don't discount fundamental things such as the basic data structures. And be wary of hot trends.

Good luck!`,

If you are dead set on learning a very powerful and flexible backend language continue with Python. If you want the likely shortest path to employment and the most flexibility in industry choice begin with JS.

The most important skill in programming is the ability to learn, and you only get better at that by learning. Don't be afraid of learning something that you might not use later. It can only make the next thing faster to learn. Plus many areas of computer science are similar enough that knowledge of one is mostly transferable to another. For example, web development and app development might use different languages, frameworks, libraries, and operating systems, but many of the basic concepts are the same. The both have some way of organizing content, some way of making the content look nice, and some way of adding functionality. The first one you learn might take some time to understand and excel in, but the second will be much faster. Pick something and learn!

The best way to learn a new field is by making projects. Learn the very basics and then try to make something cool with it. If you want to learn web development, make a website that you wish existed. You will hit a lot of roadblocks at first. Just use your resources to push through them. However, don't just follow a YouTube tutorial on how to build the whole project. Use tutorials to learn specific tools that you want to use in your projects.

Don't worry about messing up. Sometimes the best way to learn how to use something is to understand how to break it. If you learn how to use Git/GitHub, you can always revert back to a previous version of your projects.

tl;dr: Don't worry about learning the wrong thing. Just pick something you think looks cool and do it. Learning anything related to programming is going to help you learn the next thing faster.

You have 2 years experience? If you get jedi-level good with Salesforce, you can be making 200k in three years. If you want it. I do about 30k/mo billing, but I have roughly ten years experience.

But the next 600k won't involve luck. I'll have 250k left after taxes this year, and this is a long term scenario. I'll leave myself 70k a year for living expenses. That'll put 180k/yr towards retirement.

The downside: Salesforce would be your career, you'd have to pay for your own benefits/retirement, no paid time off. And you have to be great at what you do - you have to be able to deliver. The upside: no boss (just customers/clients), fresh roles on active projects, make your own schedule, always work from home. You're great at what you do, and so the work is mostly enjoyable. Also worth mentioning - most contractors aren't going to earn 30k/month. But 200k year is completely reasonable. People willing to conduct onsite training also make an absolute killing.

And to my point: mentioning these kinds of numbers in this sub gets people worked up. I get it, but I don't throw those numbers around to brag. I do so because I'm not aware of a faster way to FIRE that's available to most people. How many other career paths could ensure 200k/yr after five years with a 4 yr degree? For people willing to live in LCOL areas frugally, that's FIRE in ten years - then optionally working part time for spending money and/or the finer things.

technical - develop a well rounded set of technical skills - whether its in general software development (web based software), database design/development, dev ops skills, network development, ultimately specializing in a niche skill set that ensures employability and the desired pay rates
managerial - typically starting with the first path (1), get familiar with development practices and then build out interpersonal skills, ultimately managing people/projects/departments etc
In short, you'd need to either get good at building widgets, or get good at managing the people building widgets. The best way to do this IMO is a B.S. in Computer Science, but it's not necessary to become a developer. A degree is typically necessary to become a manager though. If cost is a limitation, then I'd recommend looking at software courses on Udemy. MIT also has the entirety of their CS (and other subjects) web-based coursework available for free online. Although it's not for credit, it's just the course material - they don't offer free classes, MIT's CS program is the gold standard education in my field.

Once you get some skills in your skillset, you can move on to finding a job in that field - the hardest part about that with zero prior professional experience is getting your foot through the door. The sources of the jobs, starting out, will be the traditional upwork, dice, simplyhired, indeed jobs. However once you clear that hurdle and get 3-5 years of good references under your belt, the jobs will more often than not come to you via networking with others, recruiters, etc.

It takes hard work - even if you're a natural at development, Java is different than .NET is different that LISP and it takes time to get familiar with the specifics of a language. Databases share a large common core of functionality, and so db development may be more accessible to newcomers. Help desk jobs, QA testing jobs, etc typically have a lower bar of entry, but rarely pay what developers or dev managers make.

Finally, there are plenty of technical/trade schools out there that can beef up your skill set in 18 months, and place you in a lower end tech job. Then its just a matter of working your way up. It's not much different than most fields, other than this: you can get to 6 figures in less than 5 years, 200k in less than 10, and some of the big players like MS, Google, Facebook, Amazon are even paying new grad school graduates 200-400k starting out. But those companies are a different breed - they'll work you hard, expect you to deliver, and are highly coveted/competitive roles. I've opted not to go that route by choice.`,

               pretty much, it slows down after a couple of years but you'll always be learning something new, but most of it is similar enough to something you've already done. If you specialize in something, you will be finishing stuff orders of magnitude faster than anyone else, which leads to great worklife balance sometimes. Once you figure out and struggle with something once or twice, for the rest of your career you will likely figure it out near instantly, but that struggle feels impossible sometimes.

If you're unemployed you could probably achieve it much, much faster.

As for what skills you should be learning, it's hard to give advice on that. Most programming jobs will be around web development. You can think of most websites as being broken into 3 parts: a frontend, a backend, and a database(s). The frontend runs in the user's browser and it the part the user interacts directly with. The backend receives signals from the frontend to create, update, edit, and delete information in a database. The backend also sends information stored in the database to the frontend. A frontend will always be written in the programming language JavaScript, a relatively easy-to-learn styling language called CSS, and an incredibly easy-to-learn markup language called HTML. The backend could be written in any of several different programming languages, Python or JavaScript being one of several options. The language that most databases "understand" is SQL. Once you get a good grip on Python, you may want to start learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in that order if you want to go the web dev route. That will allow you to build full-stack (meaning frontend + backend + database) websites.
