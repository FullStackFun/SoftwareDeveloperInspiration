Years ago, I got so sick of not being able to answer the deep-dive technical questions, and I knew I had to do something different. I started taking detailed notes in every interview, writing down the questions they asked to which I didn't know the answers. More than once, I could tell that the person doing the interview stopped asking questions before they reached the end of their question list (because I was no longer able to answer them) so I asked him if he would be willing to provide me a complete list of all the questions he *would* ask if I was able to answer them all. He did so.

Then, I would go home and work my brains out trying to grasp the concepts they were asking about that I didn't know. In every case, I would email back the hiring manager (even days or weeks later) to say, "I have studied all the things you asked me about that I didn't know how to answer in our interview. Now, I would be able to answer them. If you ever have another position come open, I hope you will reconsider me."

One time, that actually paid off. And at that job, I learned a TON, and that's the job I credit for moving me from junior/mid-level to expert.

Hope this helps.`,

I worked with a .NET Developer that was a history high school teacher for 10 years prior - he was an amazing mentor and could really explain things well. I’ve also worked with a Software Developer who was a mechanic in a past life. His attention to detail and how a software system worked as a whole and what it would affect given changing different parts was really showing of him previously being a mechanic.

The whole process took me 6 months: from printing “Hello World” November 2018 to landing my first internship in May 2019, where I then transitioned to becoming a full time junior engineer.

Though I do admit that luck probably had plenty to do with where I am, I’m sure with perseverance you can definitely do it.

Also would like to note that on top of building things I kept my computer science fundamentals sharp by reading Data Structure and Algorithms textbooks and did tons of problems both from the book and on this website called Hackerrank, as I knew most interviews would have some problem-solving component.

A good way to minimize that is to build something specific. If it’s web development than try focusing on the header or the footer or something…. If it’s mobile try a small interaction. If it’s gaming then try something like making a character walk.

If you start to feel like you suck and this isn’t for you, go play video games, watch a movie, get drunk (if you’re over 21), smoke some weed, and relax. You still will suck the next day but at least you will give your brain a rest from all of that over thinking like we all do everyday.

The only way to learn a programming language well, is by building applications.

Think of something you'd like to build, like tic tac toe, then try and build it in python.

Obviously, you will need to read some tutorials to get started.

It's practically a cliché at this point, I get it. But it holds true. If you can obtain a B.S. in Comp Sci, worst case scenario you'll start around 30/hr on the very bottom end of gig work. Even without the degree, if you can deliver, you'll get work (check out Udemy etc. - MIT has all of their online course content available fore free, and theirs is the gold standard CS program). The degree does make it easier. If you stay the course, after about five years of experience things will really start to open up financially. Most salaried positions at reputable companies require background checks. Over half of hourly IT contracts do not. Most companies don't even look at felonies after 7 years. So by the time you've truly developed your skills and established yourself, you can transition to a traditional salaried role. TBH, most middle men companies in the contracts don't verify anything. I don't abuse/leverage that, but if I had to, I probably would - at least to get the ball rolling.

I'm currently doing over 30k/month. On pace to do 380k in 2022, from home, software dev. My workweek is less than 40 hrs. I did a fifteen month prison sentence, released in late 2016, 11 felonies. I was living in a half way house until March 2017.

Now I've been at this for nearly fifteen years off and on, graduated in 2006. And I'm really good at what I do, definitely in the top tier in terms of talent. You may never hit this level financially. But not only is it possible, if you're under 30 and can keep your nose clean its probable. Salary packages and bonuses at major IT companies can go well beyond what I'm earning.

DO NOT let your criminal history limit your potential, don't let it be an excuse. I was in a half way house with nothing and no savings five years ago. In five more I'll be retired.

I am a front end developer and if you choose to go down the FE path here's what I suggest:

Get a good understanding of the command line and git workflow. You will need this no matter what tech stack you end up learning.

Learn vanilla Javascript and learn it well. Build a few small projects with html 5, css(sass), vanilla js. Get very proficient at all of these. Be able to speak about them intelligently.

Practice code wars katas. These will help your logic for your technical interview prep.

Once you've become quite comfortable with js learn React. It's amazing and there are a ton of jobs in it. Learn it in and out. Learn how to use it with Redux and Typescript. Learn hooks. Learn how to test it with Jest or Cypress. If you don't know what any of this means reference it later on. Build several functional projects in it with tests.

I would also suggest learning Angular, and next.js.

Your road to finding a full time junior dev position as someone completely self taught will be somewhat challenging but not impossible.

I'd suggest finding a good (emphasis on good) bootcamp if possible. The good ones offer a lot of benefit from network to having to build projects on a team to mock interviews. It'll just be a much faster path to a career. If not going through a front end curriculum online through udemy or code academy etc is a good idea.`,
