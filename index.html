Years ago, I got so sick of not being able to answer the deep-dive technical questions, and I knew I had to do something different. I started taking detailed notes in every interview, writing down the questions they asked to which I didn't know the answers. More than once, I could tell that the person doing the interview stopped asking questions before they reached the end of their question list (because I was no longer able to answer them) so I asked him if he would be willing to provide me a complete list of all the questions he *would* ask if I was able to answer them all. He did so.

Then, I would go home and work my brains out trying to grasp the concepts they were asking about that I didn't know. In every case, I would email back the hiring manager (even days or weeks later) to say, "I have studied all the things you asked me about that I didn't know how to answer in our interview. Now, I would be able to answer them. If you ever have another position come open, I hope you will reconsider me."

One time, that actually paid off. And at that job, I learned a TON, and that's the job I credit for moving me from junior/mid-level to expert.

Hope this helps.`,

One of the most important things learning by yourself is to find what works for you. Books don't work for me, video courses and coding along and then creating my own projects do.

The educational and experience requirements aren't nearly as demanding for programming.

You have your head in the right place. Stay confident and stay persistent. Don't let things discourage you. You will have to change your life depending on how aggressive you want to be in your approach.

Most importantly, reach out and meet people. Networking is very important for many of the obvious reasons. Additional benefit is that you learn more and it is harder to be discouraged when fully immersed.`,

It’s funny to see how different life experiences can round out the edges when it comes to a career in CS. As an example, I’ve worked with a guy who was a truck driver for 20 years before he moved to the states - he became one of the best DBAs I’ve ever met. I worked with a .NET Developer that was a history high school teacher for 10 years prior - he was an amazing mentor and could really explain things well. I’ve also worked with a Software Developer who was a mechanic in a past life. His attention to detail and how a software system worked as a whole and what it would affect given changing different parts was really showing of him previously being a mechanic.

I find it’s important to do other things that just programming/CS if you have a career focus. Having different experiences will make you a more well-rounded Developer and person in general.`,

Long story short: I got into UCSD SOM 2018, hated it, dropped out, taught myself Python for a month, then JavaScript/HTML/CSS the second, learned Django (Python Web framework) and Jquery (JavaScript Library that makes you write less JavaScript Code) and Heroku (deployment service) my third, deployed my first web-app in month 4, learned some new modern technologies my 5th month (React and Django Rest Framework) and deployed another app, then by some miracle I got one interview at an SF startup and killed it—now I’m here.

The whole process took me 6 months: from printing “Hello World” November 2018 to landing my first internship in May 2019, where I then transitioned to becoming a full time junior engineer.

Though I do admit that luck probably had plenty to do with where I am, I’m sure with perseverance you can definitely do it.

Also would like to note that on top of building things I kept my computer science fundamentals sharp by reading Data Structure and Algorithms textbooks and did tons of problems both from the book and on this website called Hackerrank, as I knew most interviews would have some problem-solving component.

CS is a completely different ball game from everything you studied both as a pre-med and a med, so be prepared to feel extremely frustrated at times, but if I could do it so can you!`,

I changed lanes at 30 (better late than never) where i decided i had enough designing websites for chump change and wanted to code them for a living. Studied Udemy exclusively and landed a gig as a frontend engineer after 12 months. Since it was a mid role and I nailed the interviews I skipped Junior and I'm killing it at the company 6 months in.

(Can deduct these as business expenses too if you have an LLC) With out a doubt credit my success to that. Video lessons, support community, great instructions, etc. College and student debt is the single largest scam that ever perpetuated our society. I then started building projects. SAVE EVERY PROJECT YOU COMPLETE. Use these as a portfolio when you interview, companies eat that shit up. Make a website, display you projects, maybe even do some light freelance work.

If you start to get bored from learning then try to build something yourself. You will have hundreds of abandoned projects in the beginning. Who cares… we all do…. A good way to minimize that is to build something specific. If it’s web development than try focusing on the header or the footer or something…. If it’s mobile try a small interaction. If it’s gaming then try something like making a character walk.

If you start to feel like you suck and this isn’t for you, go play video games, watch a movie, get drunk (if you’re over 21), smoke some weed, and relax. You still will suck the next day but at least you will give your brain a rest from all of that over thinking like we all do everyday.

Is definitely possible. And many people have done it. If you become proficient in many languages, not just python and SQL, you will be highly employable in a remote only position.

The only way to learn a programming language well, is by building applications. You can watch all the videos in the world and read all the books and you will never be better than someone who has spent 1/10 of that time writing code. In python, make a simple game, then increasingly complex games/sites.

Think of something you'd like to build, like tic tac toe, then try and build it in python.

Obviously, you will need to read some tutorials to get started.
